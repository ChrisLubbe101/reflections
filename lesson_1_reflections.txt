How did viewing a diff between 2 versions helped you spot the bug?

I made it easier, as it was  unnecessary to read through the two documents from top to bottom

How could having easy access to thee eniter hsitory of a file make you a more efficeint programmer in the long term?

I will allow for easy bug detection, easier experimentation and developing of new features while keeping the software stable

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Googe Docs does?

Pros

1.	One commit per logical change
2.	Every commit makes sense

Cons

1.	You need to remember to commit
2.	Extra work

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like
Goog Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is developed with programming in mind. Ons logal change to the program often reuires changes in more than one file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the histry of files?

git log will show each commit with a description of why the commit was made

git diff will show the difference in all files between the two commits

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

This is especially handy for me. I can do stuff and if it breaks everything I can roll back to a previous version

What do you want to use Git for?

SQL, R and web dev
